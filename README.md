# YOLOv4 Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using the **YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once)** model with **OpenCV** and a webcam.  
The model detects objects from the COCO dataset (80 classes) such as person, car, dog, bicycle, etc.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

### Python Libraries
Install required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### External Files
Download the following and place them in your project folder:
- [yolov4.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov4.weights) (248 MB)
- [yolov4.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg)
- [coco.names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this project folder.
2. Make sure the following files are in the same directory:
   - `yolov4.cfg`
   - `yolov4.weights`
   - `coco.names`
   - `detect.py`
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```
4. The webcam will open, and YOLOv4 will start detecting objects in real-time.
5. Press **`q`** to exit the window.

## 🖼️ Example Output

Objects detected will be shown with **bounding boxes** and **class labels**:

```
person 0.95
dog 0.88
car 0.79
```

## 📌 Notes
- Default confidence threshold is **0.5** (50%).
- Non-Max Suppression (NMS) is applied to avoid overlapping boxes.
- Works with any webcam accessible to OpenCV.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add GPU (CUDA) support for faster inference.
- Save detection results to a file.
- Extend to process videos instead of webcam.
